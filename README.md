IMAD5112: Project 1


The purpose of this application is to provide users with convenient information about famous figures from history, by comparing their ages with the ages of the historical figures. The main purpose of this application is to educate and entertain the user. When it comes to design, we have to consider the following: user experience, functionality, and technical consideration. 
User experience:
When it comes to user experience, we look at the things that the user needs, so looking at the application we can see that the interface is simple and straightforward and when user inputs their age the application instantly provides output. We also look at the navigation showing that our application consists of labels for our buttons and our guide users for entering age and viewing results then lastly, we look at responsive design judging from our application it is able to adapt to various screen size. 
Functionality:
Looking at our application age input is there, the user needs to enter age in a  designated text field  in a form of an integer ,then we look at result display meaning that after age input user has tap on the “Generate History” button to receive information about the historical figure judging for our application it is able to display result then lastly, we look at clear button this button allows user to reset and start all over again,  then looking at our application we can confirm that the clear button functions properly when taped on . 
Technical consideration 
When we were designing the application the programing language that was being used was Kotlin. The application is able to calculate the logic meaning that our app is able to calculate the input age between user and the age of the historical figure at the time of death, then lastly the application is able to display logic meaning that it is able to display the name, the death year of the historical figure, and a little bit of information on why they are considered as historical figures.
In this project we will be using GitHub ( goodie1/IMAD-Project-1 (github.com) ) meaning that we need a repository were we can place our main source code, version control were we track down our changes of the application, developers can raise issues and discuss improvements with other developers if project is public, and lastly the documentation which is found on the “README” provides instruction on how to use the app and how the app was developed for users and other developers. 
The main point for us to use GitHub Action  is for use to get easy access to things like continuous integration meaning that GitHub automatically builds and tests the application if the are any changes in the repository, it tests the application to make sure it compiles successfully and passes, and lastly deployment meaning some workflows can be used for deploying the application to app stores or other app platforms. 
In conclusion this application “History App“ was created to help users with curiosity on  their favorite historical figures, by  allowing the user to connect to the past whether user wants to learn about history or wants to satisfy their curiosity. GitHub and GitHub Actions help maintain the code quality. This app provides an engaging experience for all users.
